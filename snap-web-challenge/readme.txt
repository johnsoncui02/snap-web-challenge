Reality:

Menu Website:
1. Create a css file to style the website (categories)
- link the .css file to the website.html file <link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
2. setup head for restaurant name
3. setup size for header1, header2
4. resize paragraph font
5. setup class for price of each item
6. setup img to display each image in menu item in a specific wdith and height
7. margin for item description too close to price, adjusted to look slightly farther away from each other
8. magins for price item in terms of different sizes too close to each other. adjusted to split spaces in between


Time spent: roughly maximum 12 hours total : 10 hrs spent on learning : 2 hours on coding.

constraints with time:
- Can't seem to find anything on how to display a automatic updating menu bar on the left so that it displays the category the user is on.
- fixaed on trying to get everything to work on menu item paid no attention to other parts of the website as part of the requirement.
- unsure how to implement using an image of the restaurant's photo as background without interferring with the visual comfort of the menu nicely.

Expectation/Brainstormed features to implement:
